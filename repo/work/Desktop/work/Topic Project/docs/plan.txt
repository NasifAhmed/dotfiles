I am a teacher of FE exam preparing students to pass the exam. I want a question bank of all the FE questions divided into topics. 

For example lets say I am taking a class on sql. I should be able to easily access all the FE question of SQL easily. Instead of hunting the questions but opening each folder and checking the questions. Also I should be able to see the topics I need to teach for FE. Instead of spending hours on analyzing the past questions. 

So tell me what system can I make easily automated. A question bank book ? or a website ? what ? 

Deeply analyze pros and cons of every approach to solve this and suggest me solutions.
