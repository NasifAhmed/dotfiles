Craps is a casino dice game in which players bet on the outcomes of the roll of a pair dice. In the rules of the game, a player rolls two dice and finds their sum. There possible outcomes could lead to a win or loss. 1. If the sum is 7 or 11, the player wins. 2. If the sum is 2, 3 or 12, the player loses. 3. Otherwise (the sumis 4, 5, 6, 8,9 or 10), the player neither wins nor loses. However, the player continues rolling the dice until they either roll the same (initial) sum again (in which case they win the game) or roll a sum of 7 (in which case they lose the game).

The Monte Carlo method is a technique used to estimate the probability of certain outcomes of an experiment by running multiple trial runs, using random numbers. In the program, the playing Craps is illustrated simply by generating random numbers rather than actually rolling a pair of dice. The function random_int(1, 6) generates a random integer number between 1 and 6, and returns it. The program also calculates and outputs the relative error of the measured approximate probability of winning Craps. In general, the relative error Er is calculated using the following formula: Er=|(Pm\u2014Pt)/ Pt| where Pm denotes the measured approximate probability and Pr denotes the theoretical probability. The theoretical probability of winning Craps is known to be 244/495.

Recently, an e-commerce company X was cyber-attacked by an attacker. Mr. Y, the security team leader at the company, is investigating the incident and considering future countermeasures. The following is the summary of the incident: The first half of the attack: An attacker visited company X's website to collect valuable information and knew the name of a senior worker of the IT department who was only responsible for system administration. One day, a receptionist for Company X received a phone call from a man with a fantastic voice. He asked some personal questions about the senior IT guy, Mr. Z. The caller skillfully manipulated the receptionist into giving him personal information about the IT guy. The caller was the attacker who got helpful information for further attacks on the company's server. The second half of the attack: After that, the attacker dug into social sites and other resources to get additional information about Mr. Z and the servers of Company X, and then he created a password file based on Mr. Z's information and a file with the company server's IP address list. Then, the attacker remotely attacked a server of the company using the password list and an IP address of the server. Mr. Y implemented two measures as future countermeasures for a similar attack.

Company Z wants to provide secure file transfer service especially for very large files for the eir customers. Mr. K, the system architect of the company, designed the sequence of uploading, storing, and downloading customer files on the web service. In this system, customers register their email addresses and their public keys during sign up. The associated pr ivate keys reside on the customers\u2019 computers and the email address is used as the user id. The requirements for the file transfer service are as follows: Customers transfer files between each other by uploading files to or downloading them from the web service provided by Company Z. When uploading a file, the sender supplies the recipient\u2019s email address and the password that will be used with the particular file (Upload function). The file uploaded by the sender is encrypted with the supplied password and then stored in the database of the web service. (StoreFile function). The web service assigns a file id to the uploaded file and notifies the sender of it upon uploading. The encrypted file can only be decrypted by the sender and the recipient of the file using the password supplied by the sender. The password is encrypted and sent to the recipient as an email message along with the file id (Message function). \u2018When downloading the file, the recipient supplies the file id and the password.

Company V, a small-sized company specializing in manufacturing and selling home appliances, has recently expanded its team of website administrators to five. In addition, they have renovated their website to allow customers to download user manuals for their products. One day, an external security researcher highlighted that files containing a watermark with \"For Internal Use\" were publicly accessible in the public directory of the company\u2019s website and available for download. Company V has a system that ensures all documents stored in the internal folder have this watermark by default, and a rule exists stating that the watermark must be removed when files are published or shared external. The website administrator immediately confirmed the issue and removed the document from the public directory. Then, the website administrator reported this issue to Company V's security team. The investigation of the security team revealed that the issue was caused by a website administrator accidentally uploading internal documents instead of the intended public catalog files. Those publicly accessible files were a draft version of the catalogs, and they id not contain credential information such as API keys for website management. When uploading files to the website's public directory, another website administrator, other than the uploader, was supposed to verify the correctness of the files. However, they failed to notice the mistake. To prevent similar issues in the future, the security team suggested implementing to the website administrators.

Fulfillment of test items is fast, and detection of errors is also more advanced than expected. The test is still in the first half, so it is advisable to continue testing and see what happens. Fulfillment of test items is slow, so some measures should be discussed concerning the insufficiency of the testing environment and the lack of development staff members before it is too late. There is no problem with the quality, as errors are detected more often than expected.

Data can be restored immediately by using redundant disks at the occurrence of a failure. RAID 3 improves both performance and reliability by generating parity information which is distributed and recorded together with striped data across all disks. RAID 5 uses bit-level or byte-level striping with a dedicated parity disk, which contributes to improvement of performance and reliability.",

Which of the following software development models is an appropriate description of the spiral model? a) A trial product is made at an early stage to finalize a user interface and to confirm usability, performance, and functionality so that reworks resulting from specification changes can be prevented in subsequent stages. b) It is a model in which a large-scale system is developed by enlarging its scale of functions through the repetition of the development cycles of design, implementation, and testing on each independent subsystem. \u00a2) It is a model in which a system is divided into several independent subsystems. Each subsystem is concurrently developed and released stepwise, enabling the system operations to be confirmed from the initial release even if not all of the functions are readily available. d) It prescribes a series of development phases in which development process flows downwards without going back to an earlier phase once it is completed, and each phase has its distinct set of deliverables used for the succeeding phase.",

Which of the following is the characteristic of the maturity stage in the product life cycle? a) As demand decreases, some companies withdraw from the market. A company should judge whether it can become a strong player in this stage and, if necessary, should consider entering an alternative market. b) As demand increases, product differentiation and market segmentation become evident. Competition between competitors increases, and addition of new models and reduction of costs become important. c) Sales grow slowly, and success depends on whether new demand can be created. It is necessary to provide information, such as features, benefits, and price, for potential target customers. d) The market begins to understand the value of the product. Both the product line and sales channels need to be expanded. In this stage, sales increase, but investment is required.",

At the end of each phase, a review takes place to determine if the project is on the right path and whether to continue the project or not. This model has four phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering and Evaluation. A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations. This model is a sequential execution of processes. Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins.

Suppose the weather in a city, from day to day, follows a Markov process. This implies the next day\u2019s weather depends only on today\u2019s weather and not on those of the previous days. If it rains today in the city, a probability 0.3 exists that it will rain again tomorrow. Similarly, the probability that tomorrow\u2019s weather will be sunny is 0.4 and that it will be cloudy is 0.3. If today\u2019s weather is sunny, the next day will be rainy, sunny, or cloudy with probabilities 0.2, 0.7, and 0.1, respectively. Additionally, if today\u2019s weather is cloudy, the next day will be rainy, sunny, or cloudy with probabilities 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. Let us say that the weather is in state 1 if it is rainy, in state 2 if it is sunny, and in state 3 if it is cloudy. Then, the above is a three-state Markov chain whose transition probabilities are given by the following: to 1 2 3 1 03 04 03 from 2 02 07 0.1 3 025 0.5 0.25 Using this transition matrix, the probability distribution of the weather after several days can be estimated. The program calculates the probability distribution of the weather of the city after three days from the present day and outputs a 3 x 3 square matrix that shows this probability distribution of the weather.

The security team analyzed all the PCs in the accounting department, including that of employee X, and noted the following: 1. A total of tow compromised PCs were found. One PC was used by Employee X and the other PC was shared by multiple employees. 2. IDS/IPS was not installed in the accounting department LAN, delaying detection of ransomware. 3. The shared PC was backed up daily, and important data could be restored from the backup at the time when the PC was not compromised by the ransomware. 4. Employee X's PC was not backed up, and important data could not be restored. 5. The ransomware was saved on Employee X's PC as an attachment file of an email sent by a company pretending to be a business partner. The email envelope and content were sophisticatedly disguised and difficult to detect through enhanced spam filters. 6. Employee X inadvertently executed the attached file and allowed the ransomware to invade his PC. 7. After compromising Employee X's PC, the ransomware attempted to compromise other PCs in the LAN by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the target OS, but succeeded only in compromising the shared PC, which had neglected to apply OS security patches. 8. On both PCs, the anti-virus software versions and virus definition files were checked for updates on a daily basis and maintained up-to-date. 9.

Mr. Y investigated and found that \u201cPassword Entropy\u201d is the important factor for the password strength. Password entropy measures the strength of a password based on the difficulty of cracking the password through guessing or a brute-force attack. The entropy of a password is typically based on the type of characters used\u2014lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerical digits, or special characters\u2014and the length of the password or total number of characters. Password entropy formula: You can measure the entropy of a password in bits using the following formula: E=|L xLog: (R)] In this formula: - E denotes the password entropy - R denotes the possible range of character types in the password - L denotes the number of characters in the password (its length) - Log2 answers the question, \"to what power 2 must be raised to equal this number\" - |X] denotes the greatest integer N such that N <X The following totals show the breakdown for each character set as they appear on a typical American QWERTY keyboard: Lowercase letters (a\u2014z) = 26. Uppercase letters (A-Z) = 26. Numerical digits (0-9) = 10. Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, \", etc.) = 32.

The credit card information of customers is not stored in the database. \u00ab There is a password recovery system which allows the customer to reset the password through a password recovery link sent to the registered email address. Figure 1 Properties of the e-commerce web application Due to recent incidents with multiple customers reporting that their accounts were compromised, the management tasked the IT team to investigate and address the issues. The IT team found that many customer accounts logins were unnoticed by the actual account owners, and some of the accounts were used to post fake reviews. The IT team also discovered unauthorized access to the database with illegal queries executed with no trace of administration login. The IT team concluded that the incidents are most likely caused by using the same password on other leaked sites and . They proposed to implement 2-factor authentication and to mitigate respective issues in the future. The management then agreed to the plan, and the solutions was implemented accordingly.
