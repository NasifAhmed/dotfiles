Make a website that will demo the full networking demo with animations and step
by step visuals.
It will show how packets or data on internet go layer by layer. On each layer
show what its doing and what data its getting. For example for dns show dns
result, for arp request show the process of sending and getting and for dhcpt
etc.....

This is for students who are learning netowrking.
