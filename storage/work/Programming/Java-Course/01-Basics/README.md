# Module 01: Java Basics

Welcome to your first Java programming module! This section covers the fundamental concepts you need to get started with Java programming.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic Java syntax and structure
- How to write, compile, and run Java programs
- Variables and data types
- Basic input/output operations

## Files in This Module

### 📄 [Hello.java](./Hello.java)
Your first Java program! This is the classic "Hello, World!" example that demonstrates the basic structure of a Java program.

### 📄 [NewProgram.java](./NewProgram.java)
A simple program that introduces basic Java syntax and program structure.

### 📄 [Main.java](./Main.java)
Demonstrates the main method concept and program entry point.

## How to Get Started

1. **Set up your environment**: Make sure you have Java JDK installed
2. **Navigate to this folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Java-Course/01-Basics
   ```

3. **Compile your first program**:
   ```bash
   javac Hello.java
   ```

4. **Run your program**:
   ```bash
   java Hello
   ```

## Key Concepts

### The Main Method
Every Java program needs a main method:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Your code goes here
}
```

### Printing to Console
```java
System.out.println("This prints on a new line");
System.out.print("This stays on the same line");
```

### Java Program Structure
- **Class**: Every Java program is inside a class
- **Main method**: The entry point of the program
- **Statements**: Instructions that perform actions

## Practice Exercises

1. Modify `Hello.java` to print your name
2. Create a new program that prints your favorite quote
3. Try printing multiple lines of text using different print methods

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with these basics, move on to [Module 02: Control Flow](../02-Control-Flow) to learn about making decisions and repeating actions in your programs.
