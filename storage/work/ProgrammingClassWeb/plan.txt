I want to make a simple webpage for programming class and my students that will run only during class on my lan only. I will run this on my laptop during class and students will access it with my ip and port. In this webpage students can sign up with their name and student_id and in the webpage can copy paste their code or submit the code file directly with their name. On my end I can see the submitted code in a list with name and time&date, choose one and analyze and give feedback on their mistake and change the code. Students can see the changes I made or new code I added in color. They won't be able to copy the code but see and learn. 
Make sure the code has syntax highlighting in views and UI is very intuitive and easy. 
Site name should be Metro Programming Class.
