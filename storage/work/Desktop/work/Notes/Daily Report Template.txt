［Tasks Performed］
-Conducted a 90-minute Java programming class (loops and conditionals)
-Prepared handouts and coding exercises for tomorrow’s session
-Assisted two students with debugging their assignments
-Reviewed and graded five homework submissions
-Attended a 30-minute staff meeting regarding curriculum planning

［Remarks］
Today’s class went smoothly, and most students actively participated. 
However, a few students still seem to struggle with basic logic-building in Java. 
I plan to provide them with additional exercises and offer individual support after class tomorrow.
Overall, a productive day.
